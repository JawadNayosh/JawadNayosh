## Hi there 

I'm Jawad, a data enthusiast and humanitarian activist passionate about using data to drive meaningful change. With a strong background in communication and data analysis, I have worked extensively with humanitarian organizations, helping them make better decisions to support vulnerable communities. I have produced and presented data-driven reports and insights that contributed to impactful programs.

Now, I am leveraging my expertise in communication and data analysis to build a strong career in the data field. Skilled in Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, I am also pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics (Expected 2025) to deepen my understanding of data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!
