## Hi there 

I'm Jawad, a data enthusiast and humanitarian activist passionate about using data to drive meaningful change. With a strong background in communication and data analysis, I have worked extensively with humanitarian organizations, helping them make better decisions to support vulnerable communities. I have produced and presented data-driven reports and insights that contributed to impactful programs.

Now, I am leveraging my background in communication and data analysis to build a strong career in the data field. Skilled in Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, I recently completed my MBA in Business Analytics, which strengthened my ability to apply data-driven decision-making to real-world business challenges.
