## Hi there 

I’m Jawad, a professional with a background in business analytics, project and operations management, and performance reporting. I have experience working with complex organizations, supporting leadership through data-driven insights, clear communication, and structured reporting to improve decision-making, efficiency, and outcomes.

My work combines analytical skills with strong business and stakeholder understanding. I have built and presented dashboards, KPI reports, and operational analyses, and supported teams in planning, monitoring performance, and translating data into practical actions. I hold an MBA in Business Analytics and have hands-on experience with tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, which I use to support business, operations, and project delivery in real-world environments.
